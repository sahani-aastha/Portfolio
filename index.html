      <ul>
      <li><h3>Recent Advancements of Generative AI in Healthcare Space</h3>
        <h4 class="pubs">20th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Intelligent (ICDCIT-2024) | Wiley Publication</h4><br>
        <p>With the recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) andthe emergence of large language transformer-based
          models like the Chat GenerativePre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), there is a great deal of potential for transformingthe field of
          healthcare education, research, and clinical practice. This research paperexplores the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence
          (GAI) in healthcare, analyzing its current applications, benefits, challenges, and potential futuredevelopments. The paper examines how
          GAI techniques, such as generative modelsand neural networks, are being leveraged to advance medical imaging, drug discovery,
          disease diagnosis, and personalized treatment. It also addresses ethical considerationsand data privacy concerns associated with GAI
          in healthcare. Through acomprehensive review of recent studies and real-world examples, this paperhighlights the transformative
          impact of GAI on improving patient outcomes, accelerating research, and revolutionizing healthcare practices.</p>  <br>

        <li><h3>BrainCare: A Machine Intelligence Powered Mental Health Monitoring Framework</h3></li>
        <h4 class="pubs">International Conference on Computing Systems and Intelligent Applications
          (ComSIA 2025)</h4><br>
        <p>The integration of AI into primary mental health care represents creative solutions to the shortcomings of traditional models in providing
          mental health care quickly enough to meet an ever-increasing demand. This research demonstrates the role of AI in improving
          identification methods and personalized treatments to individuals, expanding the healthcare access. Among applications of AI are
          sentiment analysis, voice recognition, facial expression identification, and the integration of electronic medical records (EMRs).
          BrainCare is yet another AI application aimed at monitoring well-being virtually by analyzing physiological and behavioral data. The
          model keeps providing insight seamlessly while strictly maintaining data privacy protection in psychic web and views mental health
          management as a continual collaboration process. This paper also explores the barriers and breakthroughs that may take place in
          carrying out the integration of AI in healthcare as it pertains to its relevance in combating global mental health challenges.</p>

      <li><h3>Sentiment Extraction and Mining of Textual Content in Social Networking Space using Context based Intelligent
        Retrieval System</h3></li>
        <h4 class="pubs">ICCCNet2024, Manchester Metropolitan University, UK</h4><br>
        <p>Opinion mining, also known as sentiment analysis, stands as a straightforward yet highly advantageous real-time application of machine
          learning. It aids in discerning the emotional tone or opinion expressed by the speaker or writer in a given text. For example, whether it's
          a review, email, or any written document, a sentiment analyzer proves valuable in gauging the underlying thoughts and tone of the
          content. This application of sentiment analysis finds utility in decision-making tools, platforms reliant on user reviews, and various other
          contexts. Sentiment analysis is the task of identifying and extracting the emotional tone and attitude of a text, such as a tweet, a review,
          or a comment. It can be useful for understanding customer feedback, social media trends, or market sentiments. To perform sentiment
          analysis, you can use natural language processing techniques, such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and vectorization, to
          preprocess and transform the text data. Then, you can apply machine learning models, such as logistic regression, naive Bayes, or
          neural networks, to classify the text into positive, negative, or neutral categories. We can also use sentiment analysis to generate
          insights and visualizations, such as word clouds, polarity scores, or sentiment distributions.</p>
